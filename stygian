"Sterling fellows, the London bobbies! This one grunted something
unintelligible, gripped my arm with a hamlike hand and propelled
me off into the stygian night. Five minutes later he thrust me
through a set of blacked out swinging doors into a brilliantly
lit hotel rotunda of unthinkable magnificence."

--Farley Mowat, "And No Birds Sang"


"Sir Thomas Herbert, when at Bagdad, mentioning the coffee-
houses, which he calls 'Coho-houses,' where the inhabitants
assemble towards evening 'to sip coffee, a stygian liquor, black,
thick, and bitter,'."

--Roger Corrie, "Illustrations of Tobacco-Smoking"


"... Radford makes it almost impossible to believe that Big
Brother's triumph is less than absolute. The glints of hope which
almost certainly are illusory prove much more devastating than the
stygian darkness of utter despair."

3. (rare) Inviolate, secure from profanation.**


editors' notes:

* Greek myths described the Underworld as a dark, dismal place, a
place of shadows. The waters of the river Styx are dark and cold as
well. Thus, the word has come to mean an atmosphere of extreme gloom
and depression.

**Stygian has also come to mean inviolate from the myth of the war
between the Titans and the Olympians. The Titans Oceanus and Tethys had
a daughter named Styx, who joined Zeus when he overthrew the Titans. As
a reward, Zeus made Styx goddess of the river surrounding the
Underworld. According to Homer, the most binding oath the gods can swear
is by the waters of the river Styx.
