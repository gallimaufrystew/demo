# tcp_proxy

i was requierd to write a proxy that only has one connection available...alas...
i have tried BOOST ASIO,but i found that to write a synchronous proxy using boost
is horrible...and too complicated to meet the time-demanding projects...

i also tried libevent,...

finally i write it using raw os api...
