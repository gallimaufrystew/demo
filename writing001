Sometimes, when waking up from hybernation, the wireless interface was down. 
Trying to restart wpa_supplicant or dhcpcd is futile...for my NIC, 
I have to restart computer or unloading kernel module rtl8192se and loading it again...
maybe compiling wireless module into kernel can be another solution...
